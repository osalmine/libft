# libft
Hive's libft project

The aim of this project was to code a C library. It includes standard functions from libc and additional functions.

Usage:
```
make
```
to compile the library.

My libft includes all functions and bonus functions and 5 of my own:
- **ft_nbs** counts how many numbers does the number contain.
- **ft_words** counts the number of words in a string.
- **ft_isupper** checks if a char is upper.
- **ft_islower** checks if a char is lower.
- **ft_isblank** checks if a char is a tab or a space.

See **[subject](libft.en.pdf)** for details.

ft_lstmap doesn't pass moulinette for some reason, but haven't had time to fix it.
