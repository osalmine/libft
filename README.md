# libft
Hive's libft project

The aim of this project was to code a C library. It includes standard functions from libc and additional functions.

Usage:
```
make
```
to compile the library.
After that, you can use the libft.a library to compile the projects (make sure you include the libft.h header).

My libft includes all functions and bonus functions and 5 of my own:
- **ft_nbs** counts how many numbers does the number contain.
- **ft_words** counts the number of words in a string.
- **ft_isupper** checks if a char is upper.
- **ft_islower** checks if a char is lower.
- **ft_isblank** checks if a char is a tab or a space.

**Edit:**
After completing projects after this, I have added [get_next_line](https://github.com/osalmine/get_next_line) and [ft_printf](https://github.com/osalmine/ft_printf) to my libft along with some functions I made for those projects (e.g. ft_dtoa and ft_itoa_base)

See **[subject](libft.en.pdf)** for details.

ft_lstmap doesn't pass moulinette for some reason, but haven't had time to fix it.
