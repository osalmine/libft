# libft
Hive's libft project

The aim of this project was to code a C library. It includes standard functions from libc and additional functions.

Usage:
```
make
```
to compile the library.

See **[subject](libft.en.pdf)** for details.

ft_lstmap doesn't pass moulinette for some reason, but haven't had time to fix it.
